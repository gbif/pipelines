Abundance information is available for all records found within quantitative survey limits (50 x 5 m swathes during a single swim either side of the transect line, each distinguished as a Block), and out-of-survey records are identified as presence-only (Method 0). Although surveys are undertaken as part of monitoring programs at particular locations (mostly in Australia), this dataset contains does not include repeat surveys of sites.\r\n\r\nSUPERSEDED BY (appears in 2 collections): \r\n* IMOS - National Reef Monitoring Network - Global reef fish abundance and biomass\r\n  https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/b273fafa-03d6-4fc2-9acf-39d8c06581e5\r\n* IMOS - National Reef Monitoring Network - Global off-transect species observations\r\n  https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/a73907b7-3686-4dcf-8a1d-7efc4e5ffc05","techDescription":null,"dataCollectionProtocolName":null,"dataCollectionProtocolDoc":null,"suitableFor":null,"suitableForOtherDetail":null,"focus":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"state":"","websiteUrl":null,"alaPublicUrl":"https://collections-test.ala.org.au/public/show/dr18391","logoRef":{"filename":"RLS_logo_s.png","caption":null,"copyright":null,"attribution":null,"uri":"https://collections-test.ala.org.au/data/dataResource/RLS_logo_s.png"},"networkMembership":null,"hubMembership":[],"taxonomyCoverageHints":[],"attributions":[],"dateCreated":"2022-03-23T18:00:43Z","lastUpdated":"2022-07-31T23:00:29Z","userLastModified":"david.martin@csiro.au","rights":"Edgar, GJ and Stuart-Smith, RD, “Systematic global assessment of reef fish communities by the Reef Life Survey program”, Scientific Data, 1 Article 140007. doi:10.1038/sdata.2014.7 ISSN 2052-4463 (2014) \r\n\r\nThe data described in this record are the intellectual property of the Reef Life Survey Foundation Inc. and is managed by the University of Tasmania through the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), University of Tasmania.
