In 2014, Eremaea Birds merged with eBird, allowing members to be part of a larger global birding community and ensuring the ongoing existence of the enterprise.\r\neBird Overview\r\n\r\nA real-time, online checklist program, eBird has revolutionized the way that the birding community reports and accesses information about birds. Launched in 2002 by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and National Audubon Society, eBird provides rich data sources for basic information on bird abundance and distribution at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.\r\n\r\neBirdâ€™s goal is to maximize the utility and accessibility of the vast numbers of bird observations made each year by recreational and professional bird watchers. It is amassing one of the largest and fastest growing biodiversity data resources in existence. For example, in March 2012, participants reported more than 3.1 million bird observations across North America!\r\n\r\nThe observations of each participant join those of others in an international network of eBird users. eBird then shares these observations with a global community of educators, land managers, ornithologists, and conservation biologists. In time these data will become the foundation for a better understanding of bird distribution across the western hemisphere and beyond.","techDescription":null,"dataCollectionProtocolName":null,"dataCollectionProtocolDoc":null,"suitableFor":null,"suitableForOtherDetail":null,"focus":null,"state":null,"websiteUrl":"http://ebird.org/content/australia/","alaPublicUrl":"https://collections-test.ala.org.au/public/show/dr2009","networkMembership":null,"hubMembership":[],"taxonomyCoverageHints":[],"attributions":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-12T04:03:42Z","lastUpdated":"2021-01-19T05:43:08Z","userLastModified":"biocache","rights":null,"licenseType":"CC0","licenseVersion":"1.0","citation":"eBird Basic Dataset.
