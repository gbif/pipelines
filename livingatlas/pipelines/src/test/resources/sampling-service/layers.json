Where Australia has agreements with neighbouring countries these treaty lines are also included in the data.\r\n\r\nThe dataset has been compiled by Geoscience Australia in consultation with other relevant Commonwealth Government agencies including the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as well as the Australian Hydrographic Office.\r\n\r\nsee also: http://www.ga.gov.au/image_cache/GA7675.pdf",
